scalmon
=======

A pokemon-like game, implemented in scala as student project work.

## Setup Dev Environment

git clone https://github.com/themerius/scalmon.git
cd scalmon
sbt eclipse

In Eclipse (Scala IDE) use the Import Wizard to
import Existing Projects into Workspace.
Import scalmon as existing project into your workspace
(only as reference, copy is _not_ necessary, so you can
use terminal sbt and eclipse and git as usual).
